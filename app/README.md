Contact archivation / synchronisation app by me.

Database is hosted online, so you do not need to set up anything, just build, run and hopefully enjoy.
In case of problems with SSL certificates, try switching URLS to/from https to/from http.

If you want to test remote/local sync of contacts, simple create contact through my "Add contact" button,
sync it with server, and remove from local storage with system app "Contacts".

Now you can see the contact being in non-synced, red color.
